      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I’m Avery Holmes — a risk and governance professional, Air National Guard
        intelligence officer, and software engineering student making a deliberate transition
        into software development.

        <h2>Where I’m Coming From</h2>
        <p>
          Professionally, I work at Fannie Mae in HR Risk/Governance, where I’ve spent my time
          thinking in systems: how policies get implemented, how controls hold up under pressure,
          how organizations manage risk at scale, and how to build repeatable processes that don’t
          break when the environment changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          In parallel, I serve as an Intelligence Officer in the Air National Guard. That role
          reinforces discipline, accountability, and planning — but it also trains a specific kind
          of thinking: analyze messy information, form a clear picture, make decisions with limited
          time, and execute.

        <h2>Why Software Engineering</h2>
        <p>
          I didn’t come into software through a traditional computer science track. I came into it
          because I’m wired to solve problems and build systems that work — and because I’ve seen
          firsthand how broken experiences can hit families when they’re already carrying enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          My long-term “why” is simple: I want to build software that reduces friction for people,
          especially in healthcare experiences where time, accuracy, and empathy matter. I’m
          particularly interested in the real-world impact of reliable systems — like electronic
          health record workflows that don’t fail the people who need them most.
        </p>

        <h2>Family, Motivation, and Grit</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a husband and a dad. My wife, Mary, and I met through West Virginia University band,
          and we’ve built a full life together. We have four daughters, and being a father changes
          how you measure success — it stops being about what sounds impressive and becomes about
          what creates stability, opportunity, and a better future for your family.
        </p>
        <p>
          Part of my drive comes from navigating hard situations that don’t care about your plans.
          It forced me to level up my discipline and follow-through. When I commit to learning
          something, I’m not doing it casually — I’m doing it to win.
        </p>

        <h2>My Software Engineering Path So Far</h2>
        <p>
          I’m currently enrolled in West Virginia University’s Online Master of Science in Software
          Engineering (MSSE). I completed:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>SENG 505 (Java)</strong> — A/A+ (core OOP foundations, collections, and problem-solving)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>SENG 520 (Software Analysis &amp; Design)</strong> — A/A+ (design thinking and structured analysis)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I started programming with Java fundamentals (including ITP 120) and built a baseline in:
          variables, loops, methods, classes, arrays/ArrayLists, basic I/O, and introductory stacks/queues.
          Like most people learning to code, some concepts clicked immediately and others required reps.
          I’m building the problem-solving muscle intentionally now — not just completing assignments.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>What I’m Learning Now</h2>
        <p>
          To become competitive for full-stack or front-end roles, I’m working through a structured
          path in modern web development:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>HTML &amp; CSS fundamentals (structure, layout, responsiveness)</li>
          <li>JavaScript fundamentals + DOM (logic, events, real interactivity)</li>
          <li>React (components, state, hooks, building real UIs)</li>
          <li>Node + Express (APIs and server-side development)</li>
          <li>PostgreSQL (data modeling, queries, CRUD, relationships)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In parallel, I’m returning to Java for data structures and algorithms over time so my core
          fundamentals match my ambition. I’m not aiming to “finish a course.” I’m aiming to become
          the type of engineer who can ship features, debug under pressure, and explain decisions clearly.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>What I Bring to a Software Engineering Team</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Systems thinking:</strong> risk/governance work trains you to design for real-world constraints.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Process discipline:</strong> military and corporate environments both punish sloppy execution.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Communication:</strong> translating complex requirements into clear decisions is a daily skill.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bias toward action:</strong> I don’t wait for perfect conditions — I plan, build, iterate.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>What I’m Building Toward</h2>
        <p>
          My near-term goal is to be competitive for a full-stack or front-end role within the next
          12–18 months, ideally in a Fortune 50 environment where I can grow quickly and work on
          meaningful systems. I care about compensation because I’m supporting a family — but I care
          just as much about the work: building reliable products, learning from strong engineers, and
          improving every week.
        </p>

          This site will evolve as I ship projects. If you want to see what I’m working on, check the
